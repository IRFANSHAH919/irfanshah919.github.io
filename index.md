# Irfan Shah (919 World)

This is Muhammad Irfan Shah, a budding civil Engineer. He is ambitious, adventurous, assiduous, animated, and an alliteration advocate. He is currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in CE.

## A Cinephile and A Melomaniac
Irfan will choose to watch a movie over everything. From Hollywood to Iranian Cinema, silent era to CGI, shorts to 6 hour longs, Western to Thriller, low budget to big budget, he loves them all. No movie is good or bad, it’s just a matter of taste!

Irfan has two strict rules, “Whoever says that The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest movie of all time, he doesn’t talk movies with them.” The other rule, he doesn’t talk about it.

To have a good taste in music is a blessing. It depends on his mood what song he will listen to. It can be Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Bob Dylan, Pt Ravi Shankar, Led Zeppelin, Ustadh Bismillah Khan, Tupac Shakur, Mohsen Namjoo anything. He usually listens to Urdu, Persian, English, Hindi, Kashmiri songs.
